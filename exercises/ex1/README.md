# Exercise 1: Use case 1: Workzone user

### Persona

As an SAP Workzone user, you want to gain analytical insights without leaving the platform. Although you are an expert in your field, your limited time and experience with analytic tools make natural language your preferred interface.

### Objective

Following this initial engagement, later exercises will highlight areas for improvement so the user experience can be enhanced, making life even easier for users.

## Instructions

## Summary
Joule provides analytical insights through natural language by accessing data models you are authorised to view.
+ Conversations are saved and can be revisited later.
+ Each conversation retains a ‘context’ that allows for continuous interactions and refinement, enabling you to ask questions without re-entering previous prompts.

### Joule depends on Just Ask
+ In the next exercise, you will use the ‘just ask’ feature in SAP Analytics Cloud to access the same model you used with Joule.
+ Joule depends on Just Ask in the background and cannot access data models without it. Therefore, any investment made in Just Ask so far remains valuable and is essential to Joule.
