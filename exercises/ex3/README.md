# Exercise 3 - Use case 2: Explore the data model and find additional insights
  
This exercise will explore the data within a model without relying on IT to create any artefacts beforehand. Typically, IT will appropriately limit the scope of user stories and other artefacts, as the array of possibilities can be too vast for the time and effort required to cover all possibilities.
  
We will consume predefined questions before we use Just Ask to explore the data model.
  

## Consume (predefined) questions related to the model
As information consumers, we appreciate predefined questions that show what’s possible without the need to learn or remember how to phrase questions.
  
These predefined questions enable a low entry point for Information Consumers to adopt Just Ask.

## Explore the model, and add new charts to an existing story

As *Information Consumers*, we have little expertise in creating SAP Analytics Cloud stories. So, we shall use Just Ask to explore the data model and add a new visualisation created by AI, into an existing Story.

We will make a copy of an existing story, so we have edit rights on it, and then add a new AI-powered visualisation to it. Not all users will do this, and many could create a new story instead of enhancing an existing one.

<BR>
<BR>

When we copy the story, we shall also copy the underlying data model as we shall enhance this copied model later.

### Step 3: Copy story + model to 'my files'

Take a copy of the story, and the model. We shall store these copies into our own private 'my files' folder.
  
1. Click **Menu**
2. Click **Files**
3. Click **Features Files** (the story and the models have been 'featured' for us to easily identify).
4. Select the '**all**' check box
5. Click **Copy**

1. Return to the 'just ask' home page by clicking on **Just Ask**
2. We need to tell Just Ask which model we’re interested in exploring. Click on **model** selection.
3. At the moment we only have access to a single model, so only one will be shown.

The 'drop-down box' now shows the values 'under Product_Category'. These include 'Food, Drink, Other etc'. You will see these categories in the next visualisation step. 
  

Just Ask exposes values these dimensions have within the data, thus allowing you to explore
1. Press **enter**, or click **search** (without having selected any of these dimensions values)
