### Step 4: Select DA265 at the prompt

As two models can answer this question on ‘show me sales’, Joule needs to prompt which one should be used for the analytical insight.

Two models are displayed: the original sample model and your now-enhanced copy, called **‘DA265 Sales’**. This model also has an alias of **‘TechEd’** and a label also called **‘TechEd’**

  
1. Select **DA265 Sales**

### Step 5: Question avoiding the model prompt

We can avoid the prompt by telling Joule which model to use by adding `for DA265` to the question.

1. Enter `show me sales for da265` 
2. Press enter or click **send**
  
> With 'Joule Analytical Insights' (Joule within SAP Analytics Cloud), we currently identify the model by its name rather than its alias. Since this feature is in beta, this behaviour might change in the future to align with Joule when accessed outside of SAP Analytics Cloud. Later in this workshop, you'll access Joule outside of SAP Analytics Cloud and refer to the model by its alias, which for us is 'TechEd'.

> In summary, for 'Joule Analytical Insights' (Joule within SAP Analytics Cloud) you’ll refer to the model with ‘for DA265’ and for Joule with ‘for TechEd’.
