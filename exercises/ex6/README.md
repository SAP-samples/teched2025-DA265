# Exercise 6 - Comparing Joule inside and outside SAP Analytics Cloud

## Overview

### Persona

You are an occasional SAP Analytics Cloud user and an information consumer, preferring natural language for exploring insights across different models. A conversational interface is vital to help you add customised content to your Stories.

### Objective

+ The purpose is to demonstrate how Joule’s conversational features in SAP Analytics Cloud can aid in creating new content, either by copying and pasting or by exploring analytical insights generated by Joule. 
+ It also aims to explain the differences in functionality when Joule is used outside versus inside SAP Analytics Cloud. When Joule is used within SAP Analytics Cloud, it is referred to as Joule Analytical Insights.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note Joule Analytical Insights is currently beta and not generally available.



## Instructions

We estimate these instructions will take about 10 minutes to complete.

> It’s important to note that Joule Analytical Insights is currently in beta and not generally available. This means some features are not yet complete, and you may encounter a few anomalies and issues.

### Step 3: Show me sales

1. Enter `show me sales` 
2. Press enter or click **send**

### Step 4: Select DA265 at the prompt

As two models can answer this question on ‘show me sales’, Joule needs to prompt which one should be used for the analytical insight.

Two models are displayed: the original sample model and your now-enhanced copy, called **‘DA265 Sales’**. This model also has an alias of **‘TechEd’** and a label also called **‘TechEd’**


> [!CAUTION]
> If the prompt with two models isn't visible as shown in the screenshot, wait a few minutes and try again. Since you're using a beta feature, this issue may occur occasionally. Consider returning to this step 4 later, and skip to step 6 for 6.1 and 6.2 (6.3 will likely show it doesn't know 'DA265', so then skip to Step 7).
  
1. Select **DA265 Sales**

### Step 5: Question avoiding the model prompt

We can avoid the prompt by telling Joule which model to use by adding `for DA265` to the question.

1. Enter `show me sales for da265` 
2. Press enter or click **send**
  
> [!TIP]
> With 'Joule Analytical Insights' (Joule within SAP Analytics Cloud), we currently identify the model by its name rather than its alias. Since this feature is in beta, this behaviour might change in the future to align with Joule when accessed outside of SAP Analytics Cloud. Later in this workshop, you'll access Joule outside of SAP Analytics Cloud and refer to the model by its alias, which for us is 'TechEd'.  

> [!TIP]
> In summary, for 'Joule Analytical Insights' (Joule within SAP Analytics Cloud) you’ll refer to the model with ‘for DA265’ and for Joule with ‘for TechEd’.

### Step 6: Copy-paste, ask another question
  
With Joule Analytical Insights we can easily copy and paste any visualisation into a Story.
  
1. Click **Copy**
2. Select **Paste** which will paste the visualisation from Joule Analytical Insights into our story.
3. Enter `show me sales by store for da265` 
4. Press enter or click **send**

> [!CAUTION]
> If Joule indicates it doesn't have information on DA265, please retry later. You might also skip to step 7 and come back to this step afterwards.

### Step 7: Explore Joule Analytical Insights
  
Joule Analytical Insights also enables us to explore the visualisation and enhance it as we see fit.  Whilst we could just ask for a pie-chart, we shall explore to see the benefits.

1. Click **Explore**
