# Exercise 8 - AI-Assisted Commenting


## Overview

### Persona

You are an SAP Analytics Cloud planning user involved in the planning cycle. Your role includes adding and reviewing comments from stakeholders, often in different languages. Once a quarter, you summarise these comments and provide recommendations.


### Objective

Discover how easy it is to use generative AI and the AI-powered commentary feature in SAP Analytics Cloud, especially for summarising individual comments, extended comment threads, or hierarchically organised comments. This tool is especially helpful when comments are in a language different from yours.



## Instructions

1. Click back to the browser tab **SAP Analytics Cloud** 
2. Close Joule for Analytical Insights by clicking the **Joule** icon.
3. Close Just Ask, by clicking the **Just Ask** icon
4. Select the page **Sales Performance Commentary**
