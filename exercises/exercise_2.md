# Exercise 2: Use case 2: Explore the data model and find additional insights
  
This exercise will explore the data within a model without relying on IT to create any artefacts beforehand. Typically, IT will appropriately limit the scope of user stories and other artefacts, as the array of possibilities can be too vast for the time and effort required to cover all possibilities.
  
We will consume predefined questions before we use Just Ask to explore the data model.
  

## Consume (predefined) questions related to the model
As information consumers, we appreciate predefined questions that show what’s possible without the need to learn or remember how to phrase questions.
  
These predefined questions enable a low entry point for Information Consumers to adopt Just Ask.


  

Step 1: Return to the main Just Ask homepage. Click on the **Just Ask** logo.

Step 2:
  
1. Expand the **Sample Questions**
2. Expand the model **Just_Ask_Sales_master_start**
3. Select any of the questions shown. 

  

Optionally repeat the above multiple times.

## Explore the model, and add new charts to an existing story

As *Information Consumers*, we have little expertise in creating SAP Analytics Cloud stories. So, we shall use Just Ask to explore the data model and add a new visualisation created by AI, into an existing Story.

We will make a copy of an existing story, so we have edit rights on it, and then add a new AI-powered visualisation to it. Not all users will do this, and many could create a new story instead of enhancing an existing one.

Step 4: 
If you followed the above instructions, you would have opened the story earlier, so you should skip this step. If you did not open the story beforehand, open it now.

Step 5: 
  
  As we don’t have edit rights on this story, we need to make a copy. We will do so via the ‘save as’ workflow.
1. Select **File**
2. Select **Save As...**

Step 6:
  
1. Select **Just Ask Workshop** folder (or navigate to it)
2. Select the folder corresponding to your user ID: **Just Ask 0${number}**.

Step 7:
  
1. Checking the folder is correct **Just Ask Workshop / Just Ask 0${number}**
2. Change the name to `Sales Summary 0${number}`
3. Press **Save**.

Step 8: 
  
1. As you now have full edit rights on this copied story, reload the browser page to open in edit mode. Click ‘reload’ the browser page.

Step 9: 
  Enter Edit mode. Click on **Edit**.
  
If the edit option is not available, you probably missed the previous step.

Step 11. We need to tell Just Ask which model we’re interested in exploring
  
1.	Click **Select model**
2.	Select the **Just Ask Sales master start model**

Step 12:
  
1. Place the cursor in the search box by clicking the **search box**.
2. No action, just observe the drop-down box appearing with measures, dates, versions, and dimensions.

<BR>
<BR>

Step 13: While the 'drop-down' box shows available options, another method clarifies hierarchies more effectively.
  
1. Click the **+** icon (and do **NOT** use the drop-down list box, since the '+' menu exposes the model structure)
2. Observe that Brand is a hierarchy and Corporation is under Brand. Click **Corporation**.

<BR>
<BR>

Step 14: With 'Corporation' selected the 'drop-down box' now shows the values 'under Corporation'.
  
1.	Click on the value **Global Essence Group** (a value of Corporation)

<BR>
<BR>

Step 15: With *Corporation Global Essence Group* selected
  
1. Click the **+** icon
2. Select the dimension **Product_Category**

<BR>
<BR>

Step 16: 
  The 'drop-down box' now shows the values 'under Product_Category'. These include 'Food, Drink, Other etc'. You will see these categories in the next visualisation step. 
  

Just Ask exposes values these dimensions have within the data, thus allowing you to explore
1. Press **enter**, or click **search**

<BR>
<BR>

Step 17: 
  
1.	You did not need to specify a measure, so a default measure has been added for you. **Observe** the message saying 'Sales was added automatically'. 
2.	As you are happy with this visualisation, you want to add it to the story. Click **Copy**. You will soon '*paste*' it into your copied story.
3.	Click **Exit Just Ask**

<BR>



Step 18: 
  
1. Select the **Empty Page**.
2. Select the **copy/paste** icon.
3. Select **Paste**

  
If nothing is pasted, open Just Ask to access the visualisation and click **copy** again before exiting Just Ask to repeat this step.

<BR>

Step 19:
  
1. **Re-size** the chart to make it larger.
2. Press **Save**, under **File**.

<BR>
<BR>

You have now used Just Ask to explore the data model and added a new visualisation into a story you took a copy of.

<BR>
<BR>

If they have the rights, users may decide to create new Stories rather than edit copies of existing ones.
